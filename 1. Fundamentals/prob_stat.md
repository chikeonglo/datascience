* Probability - chance of occuring
* Statistics - analysis of dataset

## Summary Statistics
From <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/summary-statistics/">"Statistics How To"</a>, summary statistics has 3 main categories
* Measures of location
* Measures of Spread
* Graph and Charts

*Caveat* - these typically refers to **continuous** variables

For **categorical** variables, 
* count
* unique
* frequency
* etc...

## Distributions
There are a lot of distributions, each with different assumptions for modelling different situations.

In data science, the most common distributions you should know and will encounter are  
* Uniform
* Normal
* Exponential (Log)

Most of the machine learning models makes an assuption that the underlying models are normally distributed. Encountering the remaining two distributions often tells you that some tweaking is needed (processing the data, adjusting the model, etc...)
