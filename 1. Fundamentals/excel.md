## Cells Manipulations
The entirety of excel is based on cells, therefore knowing how to work on cells level is of utmost importance. Some things you should know:
* Panes (freezing / unfreezing)
* Grouping Data (Rows / Columns)
* Naming Ranges and Cells
* Data Validation
* Cell Referencing

## Functions
Think of functions as an operation on a (or many) cells. Besides the typical basic functions such as
* Mathematical / Statistical Functions
* Data & Time Functions
* Text Functions

There are several more that will make you into a better user
* Logical Functions (eg IF, AND, etc...)
  * These functions allows you to apply conditions to the inputs
* Lookup & Reference (eg. VLOOKUP, MATCH, etc...)
  * Using in combination with named ranges and cells, this provides a powerful method of obtaining the desired data 
* Information Functions (eg. CELL, ISNUMBER, etc...)
  * Debugging, better understand why certain process is not executing as intended

**Note:** Understanding this section deeply will make it much easier when it comes to python, its essentially the same thing 

## Pivot Tables
Suppose you have hundreds of thousands of rows, with several columns worth of data. How would you summarise it? Well, pivot tables comes to the rescue as it summarises the data. You can define the ins and outs, what columns to use, how to summarises, etc...

## Visualisation
I'm sure you know that you cam produce simplistic graphs in excel (eg. line, bar, scatter, etc...). Do you know it can do much more than that?
* Sparklines - produces a graph in the cell, quick look to compare the trends between observations
* Sliders & Dashboard - we can also use excel to produce a full-fledged dashboard, without going to other softwares like Tableau, PowerBI, etc...

## Advanced
***VBA + Macros***  
Suppose you want to become an excel expert (or forced to live in excel), make your life easier by learning VBA & Macros. 
* It allows you to simplifies the process that you typically do. 
* Performs an operation repeatedly? Make it easier by only using a single click
* Customised function to do what you need to do
