# Lessons from Data Science
This repository is to keep track of all the things I have learnt in data science and serve as a **guideline** for future references. This is ***NOT COMPREHENSIVE***, only a brief explanation will be given for each topic/section.

**Python** will be the language of focus here.

**Free resources** found online relevant to each section will be given at the top of each page

## Basic Concepts
Before we dive straight into data science, it is important to understand and keep some of these concepts in mind. These are typically used as a method of standardising processes, allowing others to better understand what you have done.

### CRISP-DM
This **IS** the methodology for data science. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_overview.htm">As explained by IBM.</a> 

*Things to Note* 
* This is a guideline and not a step by step process, it is meant for iteration
* A newer version has been released called "Analytics Solutions Unified Method (ASUM-DM)", but CRISP-DM is still widely used.

### AGILE
Develop in small, frequent cycles. Allows for testing and responding to changes

### CI/CD
As data scientist, we would still need to work with developers and others to deploy our models. 

*Continuous Integration (CI)* - the practice of frequently merging code changes done by developers
* ensures that when you're working with others, the code you're using is the lastest version

*Continuous Delivery (CD) & Continuous Deployment*
* Continuous Delivery - practice of continously maintaining code in a deployable state
* Continuous Deployment - practice of frequently deploying small code changes to production
